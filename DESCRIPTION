Description: Genome-wide association study (GWAS) performed with SLOPE,
    short for Sorted L-One Penalized Estimation, a
    method for estimating the vector of coefficients in a linear model.
    In the first step of GWAS, SNPs are clumped according to their correlations
    and distances. Then, SLOPE is performed on the data where each clump has
    one representative.
