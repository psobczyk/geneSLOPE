Description: Genome-wide association study (GWAS) performed with SLOPE,
    short for Sorted L-One Penalized Estimation, a
    method for estimating the vector of coefficients in linear model.
    In the first step of GWAS, SNPs are clumped according to their correlations and
    distances. Then, SLOPE is performed on data where each clump has
    one representative.
