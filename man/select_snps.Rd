\usage{
select_snps(clumpingResult, fdr = 0.1, type = c("slope", "smt"),
  lambda = "gaussian", sigma = NULL, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{clumpingResult}{clumpProcedure output}

\item{fdr, }{numeric, False Discovery Rate for SLOPE}

\item{type}{method for snp selection. slope (default value) is SLOPE
on clump representatives, smt is Benjamini-Hochberg procedure on
single marker test p-values for clump representatives}

\item{lambda}{lambda for SLOPE. See \code{\link[SLOPE]{create_lambda}}}

\item{sigma}{numeric, sigma for SLOPE}

object of class \code{\link{selectionResult}}

\description{
Performs GWAS with SLOPE on given snp matrix and phenotype.
At first clumping procedure is performed. Highly correlated
(that is stronger than parameter \emph{rho}) snps are clustered.
Then SLOPE is used on snp matrix which contains
one representative for each clump.
